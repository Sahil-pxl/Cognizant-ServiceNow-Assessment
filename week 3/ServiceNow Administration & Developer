Introduction to ServiceNow: Administration & Developer Overview

ServiceNow is a cloud-based platform designed to streamline IT services, automate workflows, and enhance business operations. 
The platform is popular due to its versatility and ability to provide a no-code environment, which means you don’t need extensive
coding knowledge to create and manage applications.

This guide will introduce you to both ServiceNow Administration and Development, providing a beginner-friendly understanding of what 
these roles entail and how the platform operates.

Admin and Developer Role Overview
The course is divided into two key segments: ServiceNow Administration and ServiceNow Development. The first part focuses on administration,
which involves managing the platform's infrastructure, users, and configurations without writing code. The second part moves into development,
where we’ll explore how to extend the platform using code for more advanced functionalities.

This course typically spans around 27–30 days, with hands-on assignments that allow you to practice what you've learned. By the end, you’ll 
have real-world experience and be prepared for ServiceNow Admin (CSA) certification.

What is ServiceNow?
At its core, ServiceNow is a cloud-based platform. Like Gmail or Hotmail, you access ServiceNow through a URL, log in with your credentials,
and start working—no need to install any software on your computer. The platform enables you to develop and manage workflows, automate tasks,
and even create your own applications without the need for extensive programming skills.

This no-code environment is what makes ServiceNow unique and accessible to professionals from non-technical backgrounds.

ServiceNow’s Key Modules
Incident Management: Helps track and resolve issues or disruptions in services.
Problem Management: Identifies and eliminates the root causes of recurring incidents.
Change Management: Manages system changes in a controlled way to prevent further issues.
IT Asset Management (ITAM): Manages physical and digital assets throughout their lifecycle.
These core modules provide the foundation for many other advanced features like HR Management, Customer Support, Cloud Management, 
and Business Management.

Hands-On Training
The course emphasizes hands-on training from Day 1. Each session is designed to let you work directly on ServiceNow instances, allowing you to gain 
practical experience in both administrative and developer roles.

You’ll start by learning how to manage user accounts, configure the system, and create reports. Once comfortable, you'll move into ServiceNow development,
where you will create applications, build websites (like service portals), and customize the platform based on client needs.

ServiceNow’s Growth and Career Opportunities
ServiceNow has experienced exponential growth since its inception in 2004. From its humble beginnings, the platform is now used by major corporations like 
Netflix, American Express, and Citibank. Its stock price has soared from around $0.36 in its early days to over $500 today, reflecting its importance in 
the IT and business world.

For professionals, this means ServiceNow skills are in high demand, offering roles like System Administrator, Developer, Business Analyst, and more. As 
organizations continue to adopt cloud-based solutions, knowledge of ServiceNow can open doors to lucrative career opportunities.

Creating ServiceNow Instances and Applications
Students are encouraged to sign up for free development instances at developer.servicenow.com. These instances are fully functional environments where you 
can create, test, and manage applications.

For example, through the Service Portal, you can build customer-facing websites similar to Amazon or Flipkart, where users can request products or services. 
All of this can be done without writing a single line of code, thanks to the platform’s built-in App Engine Studio and Service Catalog features.

ServiceNow for Non-IT Professionals
One of the key advantages of ServiceNow is its accessibility. Whether you come from a non-IT background, such as Pharmacy, Cybersecurity, or even Homemaking, 
the platform’s no-code environment allows you to quickly adapt and contribute to projects. For those interested in coding, ServiceNow also offers opportunities 
to write specific code as you move into more advanced development tasks.

How to Become a Certified ServiceNow Administrator (CSA)
ServiceNow offers the Certified System Administrator (CSA) certification, which validates your understanding of the platform. As part of this course, you'll be
guided on how to prepare for the CSA exam, including access to interview questions, study guides, and even free exam vouchers (valued at $300).

What Will a ServiceNow Admin Do?
As a ServiceNow Admin, you’ll be responsible for managing users, handling system configurations, and creating dashboards and reports. For example, admins create 
tables, load data into the system, manage workflows, and ensure that everything runs smoothly for end-users.
