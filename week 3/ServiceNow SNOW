Introduction to ServiceNow
ServiceNow is a powerful cloud-based platform designed to help organizations manage their digital workflows more efficiently. 
It offers a wide range of services and applications, focusing on automating processes across various industries. The course 
introduces users, especially those from non-IT backgrounds, to the essentials of ServiceNow, enabling them to start building 
applications without needing to write complex code.

Cloud-Based Platform Overview
Just like Gmail, which allows you to access your emails from anywhere through the cloud, ServiceNow operates similarly. 
It’s a Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS), providing organizations with tools to build applications and workflows hosted in the cloud.
The advantage here is that applications can be developed and managed from anywhere, without worrying about physical hardware or servers.

Key Services in ServiceNow
ServiceNow is primarily known for its IT Service Management (ITSM), which serves as the foundation for various other modules such as:

Incident Management: Manages service interruptions and restores services as quickly as possible.
Problem Management: Investigates the root cause of incidents and prevents future issues.
Change Management: Ensures that changes to systems are introduced in a controlled and coordinated manner.
These services are foundational for organizations looking to streamline their IT operations. Other important modules include HR Service
Delivery (HRSD), Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC), and IT Asset Management (ITAM).

Getting a Free ServiceNow Instance
To practice using ServiceNow, students can create their own development instance for free through developer.servicenow.com. After registering,
users can access their personal instance, build applications, and explore different modules. However, after 10 days of inactivity, the instance
goes into a dormant state, requiring reactivation.

Career Growth in ServiceNow
Since its introduction in 2004, ServiceNow has experienced exponential growth, becoming a leader in ITSM and digital workflows. Career opportunities
in ServiceNow are vast, with roles such as ServiceNow Administrators, Developers, and Business Analysts in high demand. The platform’s popularity
continues to rise due to its no-code/low-code environment, making it accessible to users without a programming background.

User Interface (UI) and Navigation
The ServiceNow platform is designed with a user-friendly interface, featuring:

Banner Frame: Displays important information like the logo and system name.
Application Navigator: Helps users search for and access different applications.
Content Frame: Shows the details of the selected application or module.
ServiceNow regularly updates its interface, with the most recent version being UI16. Every six months, the platform introduces a new release, 
identified by city names (e.g., Istanbul, Rome, San Diego).

How to Become a ServiceNow Developer
To become proficient in ServiceNow, students should:

Learn the basics of the platform, including JavaScript and ServiceNow scripting.
Obtain the Certified System Administrator (CSA) certification, a fundamental qualification in the ServiceNow ecosystem.
Gain practical experience by working on real-world projects using the ServiceNow development instance.
ServiceNow Modules Breakdown
Incident Management: Handles disruptions in service by tracking, prioritizing, and resolving incidents. For example, if a user's Wi-Fi isn’t working, 
they raise an incident, which gets assigned to the appropriate team for resolution.

Problem Management: When an issue recurs multiple times, it’s classified as a problem. Problem Management helps diagnose and fix the underlying causes 
of repeated incidents.

Change Management: Manages requests for system changes to avoid disruption, with different levels such as Emergency, Normal, and Standard changes, 
depending on the urgency and risk.

Asset Management: Tracks organizational assets like laptops, phones, and other equipment, ensuring proper assignment and lifecycle management.

Working with ServiceNow Lists and Forms
List View: Shows a collection of records, similar to a spreadsheet.
Form View: Allows users to view or edit specific records. For example, when you open a particular incident, you’re taken to the Form View.
