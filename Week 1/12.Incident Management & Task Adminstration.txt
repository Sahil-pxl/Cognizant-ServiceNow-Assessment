ServiceNow Incident Management Tutorial and Task Administration
Introduction
ServiceNow’s core functionality revolves around task management, designed to streamline work processes and 
enhance efficiency. In this tutorial, we delve into how ServiceNow handles tasks, particularly focusing on 
incidents, change requests, and problem records.

Core Concepts
Definition of a Task
In ServiceNow, a task represents an item of work that needs completion. This task is stored as a record in the 
Task Table, a fundamental component of the ServiceNow platform. Common attributes of a task include a description,
 status, due date, and an assigned person or group.

Hierarchical Database Design
ServiceNow employs a hierarchical database design for tasks. The Task Table acts as a parent table from which 
other tables, such as Change Request, Incident, and Problem, inherit. These child tables extend the Task Table
to include additional attributes specific to their respective tasks.Thus, records are created in these extended 
tables rather than directly in the Task Table.

Business Value and Task Management
ServiceNow’s task management capabilities are designed to improve process efficiency through:

Assignment Rules: Automatically assign tasks to users or groups based on predefined conditions.
Approvals: Manage approval processes either manually or automatically.
Service Level Agreements (SLAs): Track task completion times to ensure timely processing.
Inactivity Monitors: Notify users when tasks remain untouched for a specified duration.
Workflows: Create and apply workflows to automate task handling based on specific conditions.
Task Assignment
Assigning Tasks
Tasks can be assigned using the ‘Assigned To’ and ‘Assignment Group’ fields. The ‘Assigned To’ field designates 
a specific user, while the ‘Assignment Group’ field assigns tasks to a group of users. Groups are configured in 
the Group Table, and users are managed in the User Table.

Assignment Rules
Assignment rules automate task assignment.Stored in the table sysrule_assignment,these rules consist of conditions
that dictate how tasks should be assigned. For example, if an incident pertains to hardware issues, it might 
automatically be assigned to the Hardware Support Group and a specific user, such as Abraham Lincoln.

Creating and Testing Assignment Rules
To create a new assignment rule, specify the table (e.g., Incident), set conditions (e.g., category equals 
hardware),and define the assignment details. Once created, you can test the rule by generating a new incident
 that meets the conditions. The task should be automatically assigned based on the rule settings.

User Interaction with Tasks
Service Desk Application
Users can view tasks assigned to themselves or their groups using the Service Desk application. Options include
“My Work” for individual tasks and “My Group’s Work” for group tasks. Tasks can be assigned or reassigned 
manually through these views.

Collaboration Tools
ServiceNow provides tools for effective task collaboration:
User Presence: Indicates if multiple users are viewing the same record.
Real-Time Editing: Updates records in real-time as changes are made by other users.
Activity Stream: Provides a log of changes and notes related to the record.
Visual Task Boards
Overview
Visual Task Boards offer a graphical interface for task management, allowing users to view tasks in a 
drag-and-drop format. This visual approach helps in identifying bottlenecks and organizing tasks more 
intuitively.

Types of Visual Task Boards

Guided Boards: Created from lists using predefined field values as lanes.
Flexible Boards: Also created from lists, but lanes are based on attributes without predefined values.
Freeform Boards: Not tied to existing task records and can be customized for personal task management.

Creating Visual Task Boards
To create a board, navigate to a list of tasks, select an attribute for lanes, and choose the visual task 
board option. Guided boards adjust task values when cards are moved, while flexible boards do not alter the 
underlying task data.

Conclusion
Understanding ServiceNow’s task management features, including assignment rules, user collaboration, and 
visual task boards, is crucial for effectively using the platform. Mastery of these tools can significantly 
enhance task handling efficiency and overall workflow management.
