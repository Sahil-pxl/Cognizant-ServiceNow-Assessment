Understanding Import Sets in ServiceNow
ServiceNow provides a structured and efficient way to import data into its platform, allowing organizations to 
integrate external data seamlessly. A crucial part of this process involves understanding the concept of Import 
Sets—the intermediary tables that ServiceNow automatically creates during the data import process. This document
delves into the role of Import Sets,how they function and their importance in managing data imports in ServiceNow.

The Role of the Import Set Table
When you initiate a data import, ServiceNow first checks whether the Import Set table exists. If it does not,
ServiceNow automatically creates it based on the specifications provided in the data source record. This table
is named according to the label and name parameters you set during the data source creation.

The Import Set table temporarily stores the data pulled from the external source.For instance,if you’re importing 
data from an Excel file, the data is first loaded into this staging table. ServiceNow then uses this table as a 
holding area where you can apply transformations and mappings before the data is transferred to the target table 
within the platform.

Testing the Data Source and Import Set Creation
Once the data source is created, the next step is to test the connection and load data into the Import Set table.
By selecting the option to "Load All Records," ServiceNow initiates the import process, creating the Import Set
table if it doesn’t already exist. After successfully running the import, the platform confirms that the data 
has been processed and inserted into the staging table.

To verify this, you can access the Import Set table via the application navigator by entering the table name 
followed by ".list" .Upon viewing the table, you should see the rows of data that were imported,corresponding
to the records in your source file.The structure of the table,including column names and data types,is defined 
by the header row of your source data (e.g.Excel spreadsheet),ensuring that the staging table accurately reflects
the imported data.

Managing Import Runs
ServiceNow provides tools to manage multiple import runs effectively. Each time you execute an import,a new entry 
is added to the Import Set table,which is different from the Import Set (staging)table.The Import Set table records
 each import run, allowing you to track and manage the data imported during each session.

For example, if you run the import twice, the Import Set table will contain two entries, each corresponding to an 
individual import session. Each record in the staging table is linked to a specific import run, identified by a 
unique reference in the "Set" attribute. This reference ensures that you can distinguish between data loaded in 
different runs, even if the same data was imported multiple times.

Understanding Import Set Tables and Records
To clarify, the Import Set table (also referred to as the "staging table") is where the imported data resides 
temporarily.On the other hand, the Import Set table (stored in the sys_import_set table)tracks the history of
 each import run, storing metadata such as the number of records processed and the timestamp of the import.

This distinction is important because it helps manage data more effectively. By linking records in the staging 
table to specific import runs, you can maintain data integrity and ensure that subsequent processing (such as 
data transformation and mapping) applies correctly to the intended dataset.

Conclusion

Understanding the function of Import Sets in ServiceNow is vital for anyone involved in managing data imports. 
These intermediary tables not only provide a safe holding area for imported data but also allow for precise 
control over how data is transferred and transformed within the platform. By utilizing Import Sets effectively, 
organizations can ensure that their data integration processes are smooth, reliable, and maintain the integrity 
of the imported information.
