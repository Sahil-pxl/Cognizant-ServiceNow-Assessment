ServiceNow Lists and Filters Overview

In ServiceNow,lists are an integral part of the user interface,designed to present records from database tables
in an organized manner. As a student diving into the intricacies of ServiceNow,it’s essential to understand how
to navigate, filter, and customize these lists effectively. This document provides a detailed look at the key 
components and functionalities of ServiceNow's list views and filtering options.

Understanding List Views
A list view in ServiceNow is a user interface page that displays a list of records from a database table. Each 
list view is consistent across different tables, making it easier to interact with and manage data. The layout
includes a title bar at the top, followed by the list header, and finally, the rows and columns of data that
represent the records in the table.

Accessing List Views:
    Application Navigator: You can access lists through the Application Navigator by selecting specific items, 
    such as Incident > All, to view the incident table.
    Dot List Command: Alternatively,the dot list command allows direct access to any table by typing tablename.
    list (e.g., incident.list or sys_user.list).
    
Title Bar and List Control Menu
The title bar at the top of the list view displays essential tools for interacting with the list:

List Control Menu (Hamburger Icon): This icon opens a menu with several options to manage the list. Key options 
include:
    View: Select a saved view of the list, which may include predefined filters, sorting, and displayed fields.
    Filter: Apply or create filters to display specific records based on certain criteria.
    Group By: Group records by a specific column, such as category, to see how many records exist in each group.
    Show: Set the number of records displayed per page to optimize performance.
    Refresh List: Reload the list to reflect the latest data.
    Additionally, the New Button on the title bar allows users with appropriate permissions to create new records
    in the table.

Customizing Lists
ServiceNow provides various tools to customize the appearance and functionality of lists:

Personalize List Tool (Gear Icon): This tool lets you add, remove, and reorder columns in the list view. These 
changes are user-specific and do not affect other users.
Condition Builder (Filter Icon): The condition builder is the most robust tool for filtering data within a list.
It allows for complex filters involving multiple columns, operators, and sorting options.

Search and Filtering:

The search tool on the title bar enables users to search specific fields within the list. Wildcard characters 
can be used for more precise searches, such as % for an "ends with" search, * for a "contains" search, and = for
an exact match.
Breadcrumbs are used in ServiceNow to display active filters.These filters are functional and interactive,allowing
you to clear or adjust filters directly from the breadcrumbs.

Column and Field Context Menus
Each column in a list view has a context menu accessible via the hamburger icon next to the column header. This 
menu offers options to:

Sort: Toggle sorting by ascending or descending order.
Group: Group data by the column.
Show Visual Task Board:Create a visual task board based on the column data.
Bar and Pie Charts: Visualize the data in a bar or pie chart format.
Import/Export: Insert or update table data via Excel, or export the data in various formats.
Additionally, right-clicking any field opens a field context menu with options to:

Show Matching: Filter the list to show only records matching the selected field value.

Filter Out: Exclude records with the selected field value.

Copy URL or Sys ID: Copy a URL link or the sys ID for the specific record, useful for sharing or troubleshooting.

Additional List Features

Activity Stream Icon: Available for tables that track activity (e.g., incident or problem tables), this icon opens
a sidebar displaying a sequential account of all related activities.
Information Icon: Provides a quick preview of a record without leaving the list view. Clicking the icon allows for
an overview of the record’s details.
Lastly,the Actions on Selected Rows dropdown at the bottom of the list view offers batch actions on multiple selected
records, such as updating fields across several records at once.
