Creating a Data Source in ServiceNow
ServiceNow is an essential tool in the IT service management space, enabling organizations to efficiently manage
various IT operations, including data import processes. In this document, we explore the process of creating a 
data source in ServiceNow, which is a foundational step in importing data into the platform. Understanding how to
set up and configure data sources is crucial for successfully managing data imports.

Recap of the Data Import Process
Before diving into the specifics of creating a data source, it’s important to revisit the basic concepts of the 
data import process in ServiceNow. Typically, when importing data, there are two primary entities involved: the 
source (where the data originates) and the target (the destination within ServiceNow). However, ServiceNow 
introduces an intermediary entity known as a staging table or import set table. This table acts as a temporary
storage location where data is held before it is transformed and transferred to the target entity.

What is a Data Source?
A data source in ServiceNow is a record that defines the parameters needed to connect to and retrieve data from
an external system. Essentially, it tells ServiceNow where the data is coming from, how to access it, and what
data to import. The data source is stored in a specific table within ServiceNow, known as sys_data_source or 
labeled simply as "Data Source."

Steps to Create a Data Source
Accessing the Data Source Table: To begin, navigate to the data source table in ServiceNow. This can be done by
entering sys_data_source.list in the filter navigator, which displays the records in the data source table. If
there are no existing data sources, the table will be empty.

Creating a New Data Source: From the list view, click on the "New" button to create a new data source. This 
action opens a form where you can input the necessary details for your data source.

Naming the Data Source and Staging Table: The first step in the form is to assign a name to your data source.
This name helps identify the data source for future reference.Additionally, you need to specify the label and
name for the staging table that ServiceNow will automatically create during the import process. The staging 
table’s name is generated based on your input, typically formatted as u_table_name.

Defining the Data Source Type: Next, specify the type of data source you are connecting to. ServiceNow supports 
various data source types, including files, JDBC-compatible databases, LDAP, REST, and custom scripts. Depending 
on the type chosen, different parameters will need to be filled out to establish the connection.

File: If your data source is a file (e.g., Excel, CSV, JSON), you will need to specify the file format and, if 
applicable, the sheet number and header row in the case of Excel files.
JDBC Database: For databases, additional parameters like the database type (e.g., Oracle, MySQL), server name, 
port, and credentials will be required. You may also specify whether to pull all rows from a table or to execute
a custom SQL query.
Attaching the Data Source: After configuring the connection parameters, attach the data file if you’re using a 
file as the source.This is done by clicking the paperclip icon and uploading the file directly to the data source 
record.

Saving the Data Source: Once all the required information is provided, save the data source record. This action 
finalizes the data source creation and allows ServiceNow to connect to the source, retrieve the data, and prepare 
it for import into the staging table.

Importance of the Staging Table

The staging table is a key element in the data import process. When you execute the import, ServiceNow uses the 
staging table to temporarily store the data before it is mapped and transferred to the final destination table. 
The staging table is automatically created by ServiceNow, and the columns in this table are derived from the 
headers or attributes of the source data.

Conclusion
Creating a data source is a crucial first step in importing data into ServiceNow. By setting up the data source
correctly, you enable ServiceNow to effectively connect to and retrieve data from external systems. Understanding
the various options and configurations available when creating a data source helps ensure that the data import 
process runs smoothly and that the data is accurately transferred into the ServiceNow environment.
