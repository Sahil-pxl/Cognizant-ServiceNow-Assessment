ServiceNow Reporting Tutorial: A Comprehensive Overview

Introduction

In the realm of ServiceNow, understanding data is crucial for mastering the platform. This approach, termed 
"data-driven analysis and learning," involves leveraging the underlying database tables to grasp the full 
functionality of ServiceNow. This document provides an in-depth overview of ServiceNow’s reporting capabilities, 
designed to help you create, manage, and effectively utilize reports within the platform.

ServiceNow Reporting Capabilities

ServiceNow's reporting functionality is anchored in its database structure, primarily revolving around the 
sys_report table. This system table holds records for each report created in the instance, making it the 
central hub for report management.

1. Understanding the Core Tables

sys_report Table: This is the fundamental table where each report is stored. Key fields within this table include:

    Title: The name of the report.
    Table: The database table that the report pulls data from.
    Source Type: Indicates if the data comes from a table or a data source.
    Report Source: When the source type is a data source, this field specifies the saved query to be used.
    Filter: Defines any conditions to narrow down the data in the report.
    Type: Specifies the report’s visualization format (e.g., pie chart, bar chart).

Supporting Tables:

Report Source Table: Stores reusable queries that can be applied to reports.
Scheduled Email Reports Table (sys_auto_report): Manages automated report executions and their email distribution.
Report Users and Groups Table (sys_report_users_groups): Controls access to reports by individual users or groups.
Dashboard Table (pa_dashboard): Facilitates adding reports to dashboards for combined data visualization.
2. Creating Reports

There are multiple methods to create reports in ServiceNow:

Reports Application: Accessible via the Application Navigator, this method involves populating fields such as 
the report title, source type, and table. You then configure the type of visualization and additional settings 
like grouping and styling.

ServiceNow Studio: In Studio, select the application scope, navigate to File > Create File, choose Reporting, 
and proceed to define your report’s parameters.

From a List View: Start by viewing records from a source table (e.g., sys_user.list), then use the column context
menu to generate a report directly from this data.

3. Managing Reports

Once a report is created, it can be managed through:

Editing Reports: Open the report to make modifications as needed.
Scheduling Reports: Using the Scheduled Email Reports Table, set up reports to run on a recurring schedule and 
email them to designated users or groups. Configure settings such as the report’s recurrence, time, and format 
(PDF, Excel, etc.).

4. Sharing Reports

Reports can be shared via:

Sharing Icon: Within the report’s interface, use the sharing icon to distribute the report to users or groups, 
or share it globally.
Scheduled Email: Set up scheduled email deliveries to ensure that reports reach intended recipients automatically.

5. Adding Reports to Dashboards

To enhance data visibility, reports can be added to dashboards. This can be done by either starting from a 
dashboard and adding the report or by using the report’s interface to add it directly to a selected dashboard.

Conclusion

Mastering ServiceNow’s reporting capabilities involves understanding its database tables and leveraging the 
various tools and methods available for creating, managing, and sharing reports. By effectively utilizing these 
features, you can present data in a meaningful way and enhance decision-making processes within your organization.
