A Brief Overview of Forms in ServiceNow
Introduction to Forms in ServiceNow
Forms in ServiceNow are crucial components that you'll interact with regularly, whether you're managing incident
records, user data, or other types of information.Understanding how forms work is essential for becoming a 
proficient ServiceNow user.

Basic Concepts
A form in ServiceNow is essentially the interface you use when working with a single record from a list or by 
entering its ID. Whether you're viewing an existing record or creating a new one, forms allow you to interact 
with the data stored in the ServiceNow database.

Common Features of Forms
Header Bar: Displays the type of record you're viewing and offers standard tools like Save, Submit, and Update.
Main Section: Contains fields that display the record's attributes. Fields can be of various types, including 
strings, Booleans, and choice lists.
Required and Read-only Fields: Required fields are marked with an asterisk, and read-only fields have a gray 
background.

Types of Fields
Forms include various field types, each serving different purposes:

String Fields: Simple text input fields.
Boolean Fields: Display as checkboxes.
Choice Fields: Provide dropdown lists for selection.
Reference Fields: Link to values from other tables, similar to primary and foreign key relationships in 
traditional databases. For example, a department field in a user form might reference the Department table.
List Fields: Similar to reference fields but allow multiple values.
Journal Fields: Used for notes, often in task-related forms like incidents. These include "Additional Comments" 
for customer visibility and "Work Notes" for internal communication.

Interaction and Customization
Forms in ServiceNow are interactive, with certain fields' visibility and behavior depending on other field values.
For example, the "On Hold Reason" field becomes required only when the state of an incident is set to "On Hold."
This dynamic behavior is controlled by UI policies, which allow for more advanced customization.

Saving Changes
ServiceNow doesn't auto-save changes. You'll need to use options like:

Submit: Saves changes and closes the form (used for new records).
Update: Saves changes and closes the form (used for existing records).
Save: Saves changes but keeps the form open for further edits.
Advanced Features
Forms in ServiceNow come with additional features to enhance functionality:

Insert and Insert & Stay: These options allow you to duplicate records. "Insert" creates a new record and closes
the form, while "Insert & Stay" keeps the form open for further modifications.
Sections and Related Lists: Forms can include sections for organizing fields, related lists for linked records,
and formatters like activity logs.
Form Views: Different users might require different views of the same record. ServiceNow allows the creation of 
custom form views tailored to specific user needs, like an administrator needing different information than a 
self-service user.

User Customization
While form views are system-wide, individual users can personalize their view of a form:

Form Personalization: Users can toggle the visibility of fields in a form to suit their preferences. These changes
only affect the current user and session.
Manage Attachments:Users can attach files to a record, such as screenshots of error messages in an incident report.

Templates
Templates in ServiceNow help automate data entry. For example, if you frequently create incident records with 
similar fields, you can create a template that automatically fills in those fields. Templates can be user-specific
or system-wide, depending on their configuration.

Form Design and Layout Tools
ServiceNow offers two tools for creating and modifying form views:

Form Design Tool: A modern, drag-and-drop interface for customizing form fields and sections.
Form Layout Tool: An older, more traditional method that uses a bucket system for adding or removing fields.

Conclusion
Forms are a fundamental part of ServiceNow, providing a standardized way to interact with different types of 
records. Whether you're creating new records, viewing existing ones, or customizing the user experience, 
understanding forms is essential for effective use of the platform. With features like customizable views, 
templates, and advanced field interactions, ServiceNow forms offer both flexibility and power for managing data.
