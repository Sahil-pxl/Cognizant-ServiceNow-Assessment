ServiceNow Platform Overview

Introduction

In this document, we'll dive into the fundamentals of the ServiceNow platform, providing an overview of its
architecture, applications, and key features.The goal is to lay the groundwork for understanding ServiceNow
as a comprehensive solution for managing IT services and business processes.This overview is especially useful
for those preparing for the ServiceNow System Administrator (CSA) certification.

1.The Genesis of ServiceNow

ServiceNow was founded in 2004 by Fred Luddy with the vision of simplifying how businesses solve their problems
using technology. Unlike traditional IT models where business users depended heavily on IT staff, Luddy’s idea
was to empower business users to address their needs directly through an intuitive and easy-to-use platform. 
This approach has led to the platform's widespread adoption across various industries.

2. Understanding the Now Platform
At its core,ServiceNow is an Application Platform as a Service (aPaaS).This term combines aspects of the 
traditional Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service(PaaS),and Software as a Service(SaaS).
Here's how it breaks down:

Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS): ServiceNow provides all necessary infrastructure, including hardware, 
compute resources, and data centers.
Platform as a Service (PaaS): The platform also includes all essential software components like operating
 systems, databases, and application servers.
Software as a Service (SaaS): Finally,it offers a wide array of applications and workflows that businesses 
can use right out of the box to manage various processes.

This combination allows businesses not only to use pre-built applications but also to develop custom solutions 
tailored to their unique needs.

3. Key Features of the Now Platform

3.1 Unified Data Model
One of the standout features of ServiceNow is its single, unified database and data model. This means that all applications and processes within ServiceNow are integrated, allowing for seamless data flow across the platform. This integration is crucial for providing comprehensive insights and ensuring consistent data management across the entire enterprise.

3.2 Workflows and Applications
ServiceNow organizes its applications into four primary workflows:

IT Workflows: Focused on managing IT services, including service management, operations, business management,
and security.
Employee Workflows:Designed to improve employee experiences,covering HR,onboarding, and employee self-service.
Customer Workflows:Aimed at enhancing customer experiences, including customer service management and field 
service management.
Creator Workflows:Empower users to develop custom applications and automate processes without needing extensive 
coding skills.
Within these workflows, there are numerous specific applications. For instance, IT Workflows include modules 
like IT Service Management (ITSM) and IT Operations Management (ITOM).

4. ServiceNow Architecture

4.1 Multi-Instance Architecture
ServiceNow operates on a multi-instance architecture, providing each customer with their own instance of the
platform.This setup ensures data isolation,greater control over upgrades,and a higher level of customization
compared to the traditional multi-tenant cloud models used by other providers.

4.2 Availability and Redundancy
To ensure high availability, ServiceNow’s data centers are paired for redundancy. This redundancy spans all 
levels of the infrastructure,including devices,power,and network resources.Customers can rely on ServiceNow’s 
robust infrastructure to maintain continuous operations, even in the face of potential failures.

4.3 Backups and Security
ServiceNow offers comprehensive backup and security measures, including:

Four full backups per week.
Six days of differential backups.
Third-party security certifications to ensure the platform's integrity.
4.4 Domain Separation
Domain separation,or multi-tenancy,allows organizations to segregate data and processes into distinct domains.
This feature is particularly useful for large enterprises with multiple departments or subsidiaries,each needing
tailored access to specific data and functionalities.

5.User Interface and Access

ServiceNow provides three primary user interfaces:

Now Platform UI: This is the main web-based interface used primarily on desktops and laptops.
Mobile Applications: ServiceNow offers three mobile apps—ServiceNow Agent (for request fulfillment), 
Now Mobile (for employee needs), and ServiceNow Onboarding (for new hires).
Service Portal: A customizable, widget-based web interface designed to enhance the user experience
 for specific groups.
These interfaces ensure that users can access the platform from various devices, maintaining a 
consistent experience across different environments.

6. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
ServiceNow's access control is governed by three entities:

Users: Individuals with access to the platform.
Groups: Sets of users with common responsibilities or tasks.
Roles: Collections of permissions assigned to users or groups, determining what they can access and 
perform within the platform.

It's recommended to assign roles to groups rather than directly to users, as this approach offers greater 
flexibility and simplifies access management.

7. User Authentication
Authentication is the first line of defense in ServiceNow’s security framework. Out of the box, ServiceNow 
uses local database authentication, but it also supports other methods such as Single Sign-On (SSO), LDAP, 
OAuth 2.0,digest tokens, and multi-factor authentication.This flexibility allows organizations to integrate 
ServiceNow seamlessly into their existing authentication infrastructure.
