Introduction to ServiceNow Scripting
ServiceNow Scripting is essential for those aiming to develop custom solutions, automate processes, and enhance the overall functionality of the platform. 
This guide covers the basics of both Client-Side and Server-Side Scripting, providing a clear understanding of how scripting fits into different parts of ServiceNow.

Scripting in ServiceNow
ServiceNow scripting is divided into two key categories:

Client-Side Scripting – Executed on the user’s browser, focusing on interactions with forms, UI elements, and real-time changes.
Server-Side Scripting – Executed on the server, dealing with databases, business logic, and backend processes.
Mastering these two sides of scripting enables you to handle almost every development task within ServiceNow, from building catalog items to creating integrations 
and automating processes.

Client-Side Scripting
Client-side scripts are primarily used to manage the front-end aspects of ServiceNow, such as forms and UI elements. For example, you might 
want to hide or show fields dynamically, auto-populate values, or validate user inputs before sending data to the server.

Common client-side scripts include:

Client Scripts: Perform real-time form manipulation, such as hiding fields or changing values.
UI Policies: Dynamically control the appearance and behavior of form elements based on set conditions.
Example use cases:

Form Modifications: Changing form fields dynamically when certain criteria are met (e.g., hiding a field when a specific option is selected).
Auto-Population: Populating fields like the current user’s name or email based on the logged-in user.
Server-Side Scripting
Server-side scripts handle the behind-the-scenes data processing, including querying databases, modifying records, and managing workflows.
Whenever a process requires interaction with the database or the platform’s core logic, server-side scripting is used.

Common server-side scripts include:

Business Rules: Automatically execute server-side logic when records are created, updated, or deleted.
Script Includes: Reusable scripts that can be called from other scripts within the platform.
ACL Scripting: Controls access to records and data within the system.
Example use cases:

Database Queries: Retrieving data from the database and populating fields based on query results.
Business Logic Execution: Automatically updating fields or sending notifications when certain conditions are met.
Client vs. Server: How to Decide?
One of the most common questions is how to determine when to use client-side or server-side scripting. Here’s a quick guide:

Client-Side: Used for form manipulation, UI controls, and instant user interactions. If the task involves visible elements in the browser 
(e.g., hiding fields, enabling/disabling buttons), it's done client-side.
Server-Side: Used for querying databases, managing workflows, and processing records. Anything involving back-end data that the user does
not see directly should be handled server-side.
Example scenario:

If you need to auto-populate a user’s name on a form based on their login, this can be done with client-side scripts. However, if you need to
retrieve data from the user table and perform calculations, that’s a job for server-side scripts.
Scripting Modules in ServiceNow
The key scripting modules in ServiceNow include:

Client Scripts: JavaScript that runs on forms to manipulate the UI.
Business Rules: Server-side logic that runs whenever records are created, updated, or deleted.
Script Includes: Server-side scripts used to store reusable functions.
UI Actions: Used to add buttons, links, or context menu items that execute code when clicked.
Catalog Client Scripts: Scripts specific to catalog items, allowing real-time field manipulation within service catalog forms.
Advanced Topics
For those looking to dive deeper into ServiceNow scripting, the following advanced topics are also covered:

GlideRecord: A powerful API used to query, insert, update, and delete records in the database.
Email Scripting: Automate email notifications based on system events or record updates.
Scheduled Jobs and Script Includes: Automate routine tasks, such as sending reports or updating records at regular intervals.
Example: Client-Side and Server-Side Interaction
Let’s consider an example where you want to auto-populate the caller ID field on a form.

Client-Side Script: You can set a client script to auto-populate the caller ID field with the current user’s information when they open the form.
This only manipulates the data on the UI.
Server-Side Script: If you need to pull additional user data from the user table (e.g., department or location), you would write a server-side script
to query the database and return that information.
Key Takeaways
Client-Side Scripting: Handles form/UI interactions and manipulations. It’s more about providing real-time feedback to the user.
Server-Side Scripting: Handles the heavy lifting behind the scenes, including data queries, workflows, and business rules.
Understanding both is essential: Mastering both client-side and server-side scripting in ServiceNow will allow you to customize the platform to meet 
complex business needs.
