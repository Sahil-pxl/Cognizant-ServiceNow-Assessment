What is ServiceNow?
ServiceNow is a cloud-based platform designed to help organizations manage workflows, automate processes, and improve service delivery. 
It's a Platform as a Service (PaaS), which means users can create applications and services on it without worrying about the underlying 
infrastructure.

Think of it like Gmail: just as you can access your Gmail account from anywhere, ServiceNow operates in a similar way. You can access 
your ServiceNow instance from any device, anytime, as it’s hosted on the cloud. This makes ServiceNow accessible to organizations globally.

ServiceNow Features

No-Code Development: It allows users to develop applications and workflows without needing to write code.
Highly Customizable: Although no-code, it provides ample room for customizations based on client needs.
Global Access: Accessible from anywhere, just like popular web services such as Gmail.
Why Learn ServiceNow?
ServiceNow is widely adopted by companies due to its ability to improve service management without heavy coding. Its low-code/no-code 
environment allows even non-technical users to build workflows, making it a popular choice across industries. It is especially useful

Core Concepts in ServiceNow
Incident Management
An incident refers to any disruption in service. For example, if your Wi-Fi stops working, you report an incident. This incident is then 
assigned to a technical group (e.g., Network Team), who will troubleshoot and resolve the issue.

Problem Management
When an issue keeps happening repeatedly, it turns into a problem. Problem management seeks to find the root cause of recurring incidents 
and apply a long-term solution.

Change Management
Changes to IT systems (such as updating a software application) require careful planning and approvals. This is where change management comes 
in, ensuring that changes don’t disrupt existing services.

IT Asset Management
Tracks all assets (e.g., laptops, software licenses) in an organization. For example, if a laptop is issued to an employee, IT Asset Management 
ensures it is recorded and monitored throughout its lifecycle.

Career Growth in ServiceNow
ServiceNow is an exponentially growing platform, especially in fields like ITSM and IT operations. Since its inception, it has seen rapid adoption 
across industries like IT, healthcare, government, and finance. Becoming proficient in ServiceNow opens doors to lucrative roles in IT administration,
development, and business analysis.

User Interface Overview
ServiceNow’s interface consists of:

Banner Frame: Shows the company logo and main navigation options.
Application Navigator: A panel on the left that lists all applications available in the ServiceNow instance.
Content Frame: Displays the main content, such as forms, incidents, or dashboards, depending on the selected application.
The platform updates its versions regularly, each named after a city (e.g., Istanbul, Rome, San Diego).

Understanding ServiceNow Lists and Forms
